[1;4;31mOh looky there, some cool text- You know, I should probably implement this into the incremental game!!

----------- Working On ----------------------------------------------------

save all images in a channel and add a command to see a random one

Every monday a new event is rolled, after 24 hours it checks if everyone wants to reroll (Reroll requirement is half the total participants of last event) 
and if they do, it rerolls it (reroll can only be done once), on saturday it checks if enough people are ready to participate, if so it will ping all participants 
and give another basic rundown of the game, if not it will say that there weren't enough participants and give all participants 1 party point before resetting
for the next event.
