You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say STAND WITH HONG KONG AGAINST THE CCP!

You both like Math.

You: Hello

Stranger: Hey

Stranger: How are you?

You: I'm okay, could always be better though

Stranger: I know that feeling

Stranger: working on any fun projects in your free time, stranger?

You: I'm actually working on an incremental game, I added this topic because of some difficulties I was having with the mathematics

Stranger: oooh

Stranger: incremental games are cool

Stranger: and absorb far too much of my time

You: It's going to be implemented into a discord bot, so incremental game just felt like it was the way to go

You: you?

Stranger: nothing quite so fun, I've been designing a self-sustaining eco-farm

You: Design is quite the field to go into isn't it? Very competitive

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: I'll let an artist make it look pretty, I'm just trying to make sure all the maths works out

You: I see

You: So like, something similar to an architect?

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: The idea is to design something entirely self-sustaining and has a minimal ecological impact

Stranger: Producing black dirt in compost piles, and using the heat generated as a passive heat source for the animal shelters and human house

You: sounds way out of my strengths, i'll wish you motivation- haha

Stranger: I've got a lot of it figured out

Stranger: But thank you!

Stranger: I wish you luck on your incremental game

You: Ah, right on the cusp of finishing- that's nice

Stranger: I might be able to help you with some of the maths, if you know what you're looking for

You: I do actually

You: It's diminishing returns

Stranger: Yeah. I've been working on it since last summer. I'm doing my thesis on it actually

Stranger: I've read more papers on horticulture than any other mathematician I know lol

You: Upgrade 2 makes Upgrade 1 10% more effective, but that gets overpowered fast. So I want the returns for upgrading it to diminish at a speed set by upgrade 3

You: I can't figure out the formula I need for that

Stranger: oooh, yes

Stranger: Uhh. probably something along the lines of...

You: You can shorten variables for Upgrades to U1 or something similar

Stranger: U1 = U1 *(1 + (1 - (.9^U2))

You: .9 being U3?

You: aka the rate of diminishing

Stranger: so the first upgrade would make it 10% more effective, the second would be 19%, third would be 27.1, then 34.4, then 40

You: I see

Stranger: tenth upgrade would be 65%

Stranger: Yeah, .9 could be modifiable. The smaller it is the quicker U1 grows

You: It would be a pity to not be able to contact you again, do you have a discord or social media of some sort?

Stranger: I do not, unfortunately

Stranger: I try to avoid the internet like the plague, but covid has made that a non-option

You: Ah, I see- i'd suggest discord to you as a more convenient way to meet strangers and have longer lasting relationships online

You: Though my opinion may be biased

Stranger: I'll take it under consideration

Stranger: the undergrad maths club I used to help run went onto discord when the world ended

Stranger: And a bunch of my other projects have discord servers bridged to irc channels

You: Ah, but you never used discord?

Stranger: no

You: I would love to teach you how to use it as a thanks for solving my problem, can I leave my username just incase you decide to use it?

Stranger: yeah!

You: Ok, cool. Pacifisity#5587 - if you have any other topics you want to talk about i'd be down.

Stranger: Awesome!

Stranger: This is a wild question, but do you know what TASBot is?

You: I do not

Stranger: do you know what speedrunning is?

Stranger: like video game speedrunning?

You: Ohhhh

You: The tool assisted speedruns

Stranger: yeah!

You: I've seen it used before but didn't know the names

Stranger: aight, I gotta step away for a minute

Stranger: if you stay connected we can keep talking when I get back

Stranger: I wasn't expecting to have to step away

Stranger: Agh, curse you world~

You: Okay, i'll wait for you- gotta implement this formula anyway haha

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: good luck with that

Stranger: so what language are you writing this all in?

You: Hehe

You: python

Stranger: Given the discord hooks I figure python or js?

Stranger: Yeah!

Stranger: go snake!

You: Also, I seem to have made it even more overpowered

Stranger: snake language is one of my favourits

Stranger: Oh?

You: STATEOFBEING2 = (ascension) + 1
ENHANCEMENTS2 = (veins * (1 + (1 - (.9 ** (muscles)))))
multi2 = (STATEOFBEING2) * (ENHANCEMENTS2)

You: veins is U1, muscles is U2

Stranger: is this like a stargate incremental? That's the only context I usually ascension mentioned

You: stargate?

Stranger: oh, stargate is a science-fiction tv series

You: Ah I see

Stranger: kind of the first iteration of urban fantasy

You: Yeah, no this is an incremental bot based on lore created by 3 nerds

You: haha

Stranger: oh nice!

You: We kinda went all out

Stranger: anything created by 3 nerds is usually amazing

You: Haha, it's quite the almalgamation

You: multi = (U1 * (1 + (1 - (.9 ^ (U2)))))

You: did I do something wrong?

You: With OP stats:
Old output: 2467582106.6800003
New output: 2861078628.0

Stranger: hmm

You: By OP stats I mean upgrades in the millions

You: which during endgame should become pretty close to that

Stranger: the limit is U2 goes to infinite makes .9^U2=1

Stranger: whoops

Stranger: I mean .9^U2 = 0 as U2 approaches infinity

Stranger: which is why it's useful for limiting upgrades

You: ah? i'm slightly confused

Stranger: So basically as you upgrade U2, you get closer and closer to doubling U1

You: okay

You: I'm still a little confused,

You: so when U2 makes U1 double?

Stranger: so U1 * (1 + (1 - (.9 ^U2))) = U1 + U1 * (1-.9^U2), as U2 increases, .9^U2 gets smaller and smaller, making (U1 * (1-.9^U2)) closer and closer to U1

Stranger: which makes it U1 + U1, for sufficiently large U2

You: Okay, and what does the 1- .9 do?

You: or was that a typo?

Stranger: Well, if you just have (U1 + U1 * (.9^U2)) for U2 < U2', (U1 + U1 * (.9^U2)) > U1 + U1 * (.9^U2')) so upgrading U2 would make it smaller if it wasn't (1 - (.9 ^ U2))

You: So what is the formula now

You: ?

You: also, could you rephrase this?
"which makes it U1 + U1, for sufficiently large U2"

Stranger: Oh yes I can

You: Oh, I see now- you're talking about when it gets super close to 100%?

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: sorry, I'm still trying to figure out the best way to rephrase this

Stranger: I've spent too much of life doing maths lol

You: I was just confusing myself because I was using numbers that were too large for me to process

You: I just dropped it down to thousands and it was simple after that

Stranger: oh yeah, that happens sometimes. brains suck at uber large scales lol

You: thank you so much, I literally spend over a day on this issue

Stranger: hahaha, no problem

Stranger: It was nice to work on a project that didn't involve writing a compiler

You: Yeah, I'm still an amateur but I'm extremely motivated when seeing my community play with my work.

Stranger: yeah!

Stranger: I wish society rewarded people pursuing their interests more than it currently does

Stranger: I've learned so much just tackling random projects

You: I've already accepted that I need to chase opportunities instead of dreams, i've just been lucky thus far.

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: You in uni?

You: No,

You: I'm technically a junior

You: in hs

Stranger: oh shit

Stranger: You'll sail in uni then

Stranger: I totally mistargetted my explanation then. I assumed you were a second year comp sci student lol

Stranger: Sorry about that

You: Haha, yeah- I knew the vocabulary but not what you meant

Stranger: yeah. most uni level stuff could be taught at high school, just requires explaining things slightly more

You: I see,

Stranger: Can't assume people have spent hundreds of hours working on something in high school, like you can with third and fourth year uni students

You: I was never a fan of school, I preferred to learn on my own terms

Stranger: yes

Stranger: me too

Stranger: I almost failed out of high school, and have failed out of uni once

Stranger: But now I'm a published researcher, so it's all good in the end lol

You: That seems to be the path i'm following in, especially with covid

You: Normally i'd just get mediocre grades and go on but with covid i've been lost entirely

Stranger: yep

Stranger: sounds pretty par for the course

Stranger: this whole shitshow is causing a lot of chickens to come home and roost

Stranger: not the least of which is the chronic underfunding of medical and education

You: of course, the 2 most import subjects for humanity

Stranger: Yes

Stranger: Well, there's good arguments to be made for sure

Stranger: More important than all the military spending in the world

Stranger: especially if the US

You: It's all just self interest, while the powers are in a stalemate this is the perfect time to take them down a notch

You: Sometimes thoughts like these make me think about how much easier an anarchist society would be

Stranger: Yes

Stranger: There are problems with that, but there was an anarchist revolution in... I can't remember exactly where, but it succeeded until the military rolled through them

Stranger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia

Stranger: Catalonia!

Stranger: In the early 1900s

You: Yeah, maybe anarchist wasn't exactly the idea I was going for- but more along the lines of having each power be far weaker

You: having limited but powerful countries seems like a recipe for doomsday

You: having multiple weak countries just feels safer in my opinion

You: sure a war between 2 countries, oh no- but that won't effect another country. no?

Stranger: in todays globalist world, it's hard to say

Stranger: You've seen how quickly covid has crippled the world

You: Yes, honestly I think it was a good wakeup call

You: It was for me atleast, watching my mother think she was on a deathbed

Stranger: It was insufficient

Stranger: not to downplay your personal experience, but globally covid was a softball

Stranger: and humanity fucking whiffed it

You: I agree

You: It was nowhere near as bad as older viruses, no?

Stranger: ahh, until omicron came around yeah

Stranger: less than 1% IFR, compared to like measles 30%, and it spread rapidly but not unbearably

Stranger: omicron now though is, if I understand the numbers correctly, literally the fastest spreading virus in the history of mankind

You: crazy

Stranger: you're living through history

Stranger: and quite possibly the first collapse of the USA

You: interesting

Stranger: It'll be like when rome collapsed into the byzantine

You: That bad?

Stranger: hopefully not

Stranger: but I'm concerned

Stranger: the healthcare systems have already begun collapsing

Stranger: They're like a beached whale right now, in the process of dying and require a concerted effort to save them

You: interesting, I don't want to say I could do nothing but as I am right now- I can't make enough of a difference for me to be satisfied. I'll just sit here in my bedroom trying to learn as much as I can before finding another office to continue learning until my eventual demise.

Stranger: it's why I wanna buy a piece of land and build a self-sutaining eco farm

You: Respectable, I want to extend the human lifespan but i've been more interested in psychology lately

Stranger: ooh

Stranger: i read a paper on biorxiv yesterday that might interest you

You: please

Stranger: yeah, I'm trying to find it

Stranger: It was talking about how covid appears to shorten telomeres, in a manner roughly equivalent to five years of natural aging

Stranger: https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/11/6151/htm

Stranger: "Evidence for Biological Age Acceleration and Telomere Shortening in COVID-19 Survivors "

You: Welp

You: rip 10 years of my life

Stranger: Yeeee~~~~

You: lol

You: I feel like ignorance would have been bliss on this one

You: So it's like in those cultivation novels, when they burn their lifespan

Stranger: I apologize, but not really.

Stranger: Knowledge is never bad

You: I agree

Stranger: now, I'd probably hesitate before giving someone details no how to DIY high explosives in their garage

Stranger: but I wouldn't begrudge anyone learning

You: Fair enough

Stranger: It's actually super @#$%ing easy

Stranger: out of a standard cleaning closet I could probably make two or three different ones

You: ...

You: I think your choices of learning material are a little out of my range

Stranger: Well, part of it is I grew up on a farm

Stranger: We used to make what I like to call 'redneck stump remover', which is just high explosive lol

Stranger: You make about a quarter cup per half foot of radius of stump

You: huh,

You: very interesting

Stranger: yeah!

Stranger: plus, if things do collapse, being able to mix up explosive will be extremely useful

Stranger: Clearing land for farming is a lot of work

Stranger: being able to blow up tree stumps makes it easier

You: I see now

You: That makes sense

Stranger: and knowing how to build a commercial composting pile. You can extract 1000btu/hour/ton from that

You: but?

Stranger: which like 50 tons you could heat 2500 sq ft worth of property, including 1000 sq ft of greenhouse space and 1500 of living space

Stranger: btu: british thermal units

You: I see

Stranger: " it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit"

You: Oh okay

Stranger: a single cow produces enough manure to make up about 10 tons of compost

Stranger: If you capture the methane released by the compost pile, you can burn it for extra energy and to increase the CO2 level in the greenhouse

You: The CO2 is used to help the plants produce oxygen?

Stranger: Well, it's used by the plants in the process of photosynthesis. Oxygen is a byproduct

Stranger: one I'm not particularly concerned about lol.

You: right I know that- so you mean to help them grow

Stranger: so, for example, if you grow wheat in a field you get about 3ton/acre, if you can control the growing conditions by increasing the CO2 and providing stable lighting you can easily get 70ton/acre

You: wow

You: That's quite the profit margin

Stranger: yes

Stranger: It's insane just how much difference there is with some extra CO2 and stable lighting

You: By the way, the numbers are looking really good now

You: Thank you again

Stranger: nice!

Stranger: I'm glad it worked out

You: Would I use a similar formula to implement a variable for the diminishing returns of the previous upgrade?

Stranger: yeah

You: If you don't have another topic of choice, we could play a little gmae

You: game*

Stranger: Sure

Stranger: I'm down

Stranger: I might have to duck out for a few minutes here to shovel before the weather falls below zero

You: Would you rather, have you played before?

You: That's fine just lmk when and i'll go back to programming

Stranger: I have played that before

Stranger: It's nearly as old as time itself

You: Would you like to go first?

Stranger: no, I could definitely use some examples to warm up the ol' brain

You: Haha, okay

You: Would you rather gain a power that allows you overpower thousands of humans together,
or, would you rather gain a power that allows you to sway people's minds easier.

You: by overpower I mean physical abilities such as speed and strength

Stranger: Hmm

Stranger: probably sway peoples minds. Then I could become the next Putin

You: Agreeable, though I would probably choose the first option personally

You: strength is quite the mind changer aswell

Stranger: They both have merits, but if you piss of the US military I don't think you'd win

Stranger: piss off*

You: I definitely wouldn't make my strength public

You: That's definitely not, nuke invincibility level protection lmao

Stranger: hmm, fair enough

Stranger: it would be extremely useful on a piece of land, be able to build shit by yourself

Stranger: swaying peoples minds would be good for building a cult and having others slave away for you

You: Indeed

You: Would you like me to give another question?

Stranger: I've got one: would you rather give up your sense of smell or your sense of hearing?

You: smell

You: Not even a question for me

Stranger: really/

You: hearing is too important to me

You: although I would lose taste for the most part

You: the loss of hearing would be catastrophic for me

Stranger: Yeah. I'm not sure I could surrender my sense of taste so easily

Stranger: I can assure you being deaf isn't nearly that bad lol

You: I'm also a very good fps game player btw

Stranger: Ah

Stranger: Alright, since that Q was so easy what about your sense of smell or hearing in 1 ear?

You: that's far more difficult, though I think I would choose the loss of smell again

You: not being able to hear in one ear would be super annoying

Stranger: It is

Stranger: It definitely is lol

Stranger: I'm completely deaf in one ear, and I have a family member that's completely unable to smell anything. I've seen the impacts of both sides

You: Interesting

Stranger: A loss of smell is also dangerous too

Stranger: like trying to tell if food is safe or not

You: Oh? I feel like as long as you have someone else make food for you it'd be easier

Stranger: fair

You: can't exactly ask someone to hear for you lol

Stranger: well

Stranger: that's not entirely true

Stranger: sign language interpreter

Stranger: and for a few of my uni courses I had a stenographer

You: well

You: I mean for your right side

Stranger: fair

You: Ok, I guess it's my turn

You: Would you rather perpetually hear someone clicking a pen in your mind or be itchy any time you close your eyes.

Stranger: clicking a pen

Stranger: without a doubt

Stranger: I already have tinnitus, a pen clicking wouldn't be much worse

You: oh, I should've figured that because you're deaf in one ear

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: would you rather be eternally stuck in summer or winter?

You: hmm

You: summer

Stranger: interesting

Stranger: I'm a winter person

You: It would be perpetually snowing

Stranger: you can always put on more layers to get warm, but you can only get so naked to cool off

You: Then everybody would be wearing multiple layers of clothing 24/7

Stranger: or keep your house at 30c so you don't have to wear clothes inside while looking out at the snow

You: That would kill our bills

Stranger: ah, but if you have 5 or 6 cows and a moderate sized composting facility it's like an hour a day shovelling shit into the composter for unlimited heat

You: I don't think cows would appreciate the snow either

Stranger: they don't mind it

Stranger: There's like 20 cows in the quarter behind the farm

Stranger: they're out there in the snow

Stranger: plus you heat their barn too

Stranger: enough compost generated heat, and you can keep them at a really comfortable temperature

Stranger: the most spoiled cows in Canada

You: lmao

Technical error: Lost contact with server, and couldn't reach it after 3 tries. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.
