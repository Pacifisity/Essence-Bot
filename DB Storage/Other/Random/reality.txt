Essence of Reality
A game based on the needs of humans and the self hated generated by spending a lot of time of gaming

Instead of having the focus of the game be on incremental growth of an online character through ingame effort, the growth of the character is based on personal growth

Spirit - Focus on the mind, and gaining mental stability and enlightening
Mana - Focus on the heart, interaction with people gives you more experience
Aura - Focus on the body, increasing physical health can often be just as import as the mind
Nature - Focus on the world, improving the world gives a sense of larger accomplishment

"Don't make gaming something you regret, make it something you enjoy."
