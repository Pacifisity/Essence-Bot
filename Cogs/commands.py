I was an avid evil hunter at the time, so whenever I came across anyone with an evil reputation, I hunted them. It was on one such fine evening that I found my quarry. A certain Bill Gates. After I killed him he respawned and came after me, but with backup. I did my best but alas, I could not 1v2, so I retreated into the forest, all the while taunting in chat. I thought I had earned a well-deserved respite, but only a few moments later the tree I was standing in disintegrated. They had found me. So I ran. I am unsure of what happened during this time, but a bit after my escape into the forest, one of the friends of Bill Gates sent me a message I think. I really don't know how it happened but I was somehow pulled into Discord with a man named Crystal.
